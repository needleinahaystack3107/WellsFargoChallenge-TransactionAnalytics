# WellsFargoChallenge-TransactionAnalytics
This Repository Contains all information regarding the Wells Fargo Transaction Analytics Challenge

Challenge Background: It is no surprise that financial companies need to help their customers organize their finances. Customers want to know what they spend their money on to keep balances in check. By categorizing transactions and building better customer engagement tools, Wells Fargo can help customers identify frequent purchases and subscriptions, sort income and activity liability with higher accuracy, and reduce credit risks. 

Transaction categorization is the ability to recognize the purpose of a transaction based on its description. For long, this process was done manually but now technology can do it efficiently. 

This Challenge will focus on Natural Language Processing using the power of Machine Learning to predict which category a transaction will fall into, given the description of the transaction. 

Challenge Criteria: Build a model to predict transaction categories using the 10 (ten) distinct categories that a transaction may fall into. The categories are as follows:

• Communication Services 
• Education 
• Entertainment
• Finance 
• Health and Community Service 
• Property and Business Services 
• Retail Trade 
• Services to Transport 
• Trade, Professional and Personal Services
• Travel 

The dataset provided on the Challenge page is synthetic. This dataset has been scrubbed to replace all transaction numbers with 1's.

Training Dataset – The Training Dataset contains 40,000 unique transactions and their corresponding transaction categories. This dataset should be used to develop your solution.

Test Dataset – The Test Dataset contains 10,000 unique transactions with the transaction categories omitted. This dataset should be used to test your solution and identify the correct transaction categories.
